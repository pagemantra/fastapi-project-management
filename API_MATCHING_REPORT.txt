5. RECOMMENDATIONS
==============================================================================

CRITICAL (Must Fix):
  1. Implement missing worksheet endpoints:
     - POST /worksheets/{id}/reject
     - POST /worksheets/bulk-approve
     - GET /worksheets/summary

  2. Implement missing form endpoints:
     - GET /forms/team/{teamId}
     - POST /forms/{id}/assign
     - DELETE /forms/{id}/unassign/{teamId}

  3. Implement missing notification endpoints:
     - GET /notifications/unread
     - PUT /notifications/read-all
     - DELETE /notifications/{id}
     - DELETE /notifications/

  4. Implement missing task endpoint:
     - GET /tasks/reports/summary

HIGH PRIORITY (Should Fix):
  5. Implement remaining report endpoints:
     - GET /reports/attendance
     - GET /reports/overtime
     - GET /reports/team-performance
     - GET /reports/worksheet-analytics
     - GET /reports/export/productivity
     - GET /reports/export/attendance
     - GET /reports/export/overtime
